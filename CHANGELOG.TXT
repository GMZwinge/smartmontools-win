---------------------------------

Known issues

- When defining scheduled tests via CLI without using unattended setup, GUI parameters aren't updated accordingly (anyway, why would one do this ?)

Changelog
---------

- Removed interactive service fix (upstream fixed it)

- Added the intial log to the test mail as attachment (Feature asked by Ilya Kisleyko)
- Added Russian translation (thanks to Ilya Kisleyko)

- Suppress test mail status window if /silent or /verysilent parameter supplied

[v6.1-4] from 20/06/2013

- Fixed a typo that prevented smtp authentication in erroraction script (thanks to Boi Feddern at c't Magazin fuer Computertechnik for pointing that out)

[v6.1-3] from 12/06/2013

- Fixed a bug where erroraction script writes empty smart log files

[v6.1-2] from 20/05/2013

- Upgrades should generally work cleaner and handle previous service uninstallation
- Upgrades on Windows XP should now work without need to stop the smart service manually
- Updated installer logic (cannot install warning support without selection service installation)
- Updated documentation --warningmessage
- Service installation now uses upstream setup (which also installs smartd as delayed start service in NT6x)
	- Restart Manager disabled because upstream's service event log integration needed to restart a lot of stuff while upgrading (trying to keep anything upgradable without reboot required)
	- Upstream service type is changed to "Non interactive" to prevent errors in event log
- Updated Inno Setup building tools to v 5.5.3
- Minor bugfixes

[v6.1-1] from 02/03/2013 (non public release, too much beta stuff for production)

- Updated upstream release to version 6.1
- As upstream started using erroraction like scripting, i updated mine accordingly.
- Local personalized messages supported via Christian Franke's very nice wtssendmessage.exe tool (ohh Yeah)

[v6.0-7] from 13/03/2013

- Update log format: Insert version in head. Insert spacer after log so next log is visually more separated from last one

[v6.0-6] from 27/02/2013

- No binary updates, only documentation fixes, therefore version number stays the same
- Updated documentation and translations (special thanks to Titus for the German translation that was desperately needed)

[v6.0-6] from 18/02/2013

- Fixed some typos in the documentation and in the program
- The first smartmontools run is saved in a file containing smartmontools version
- Changed the default behavior (no local alert messages). This can be overriden by checking GUI entry or CLI parameter

[v6.0-5] from 03/02/2013

- Made the test message more explicit so general antispam filters (tested with Exchange integrated filter) won't mark them as spam
- Fixed an issue with smartd.conf file generation for scheduled tests (thanks to Bill Day for pointing that out)
- Fixed some GUI glitches, cleaned up the GUI code
- Corrected a naming Typo (6.01 didn't exist, it was 6.0-1 only for windows installer)

[v6.0-4]

- Fixed a problem with overwrite confirmation of smartd.conf.example of a previous installation in silent mode 
- Fixed a minor issue in the start menu smartd.conf link (thanks to Willem Pauw for pointing that out)
- Have a longer and nicer test message that won't be caught by standard antispam (hopefully... it worked on mine)
- Cosmetic fixes: truncated messages depending on language

[v6.0-3]

- Initial public release
- Updated upstream source
- Temporary removed WTSSendMessage tools, using integrated support from smart deamon

[v5.43-x]

- Private beta testing
